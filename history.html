                   <h2 class="founder">Foundation by Hassanally Effendi:</h2>
                <p class="para1">
                    Sindh Madressatul Islam was formed on 1 September 1885 by a community of enlightened Sindh Muslims, led by Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi, <br>
                    as Sindh's first modern Muslim educational institution, whose doors were open to all irrespective of religious preference.

                </p>
                <p class="para2">After the end of the Mughul era on the subcontinent and the British 'annexation of Sindh by the mid-nineteenth century, the Sindh Muslims were not<br> prepared to accept the new education system. That closed on them the doors to social, economic , and political development. This took its toll and by <br> the early 1880s the bulk of the Muslim population in Sindh had degenerated into an cultural , social, abysmally low</p>
                <p class="para3">About this time, an internal reform campaign among Indian Muslims started. The three main supporters of this campaign were Sir Syed Ahmed Khan<br> of Aligarh in the North, Justice Syed Amir Ali of Calcutta in the East and Hassanally Effendi in the South-West. Education was used as a tool to bring <br>about social reform. Hassanally Effendi has taken up the cause of the establishment of Sindh Madressat</p>
                <p class="para4">The opening of Sindh Madressah proved to be harbinger of change for betterment amongst the Muslims of Sindh. Students from all over the region <br>started flocking to this institution. Though SMI was founded primarily for the benefit of Muslims, its doors were equally open to followers of all other<br> religions. Early records show that around ten percent students of SMI were always from non-Muslim communities. In addition to non-Muslim students,<br> SMI also had several non-Muslim teachers on its payroll. This multicultural and liberal atmosphere helped in creating a cosmopolitan culture<br> within the institution.</p>
                <h4 class="quaideheading">Association with Quaid-e-Azam M.A. Jinnah</h4>
                <img src="https://www.smiu.edu.pk/themes/smiu/images/quaid-e-azam-m-a-jinnah.jpg" class="quaide" alt="">
                <p class="para5">Quaid-e - Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah was enrolled in the institution in July 1887, less than two years after the establishment of Sindh Madressah,<br> and studied here for the longest period of his academic life from 1887 to 1892. Throughout his life, he carried deep impressions of SMI on his mind, <br>which is evident from the fact that he left Sindh Madressah one-third of his personal property through his las.</p>
                <h5 class="master">Alma Mater of Freedom Fighters:</h5>
                <p class="para6">In addition to Quaid-e-Azam, Sindh Madressah has educated several leading lights of firstly struggle for separation of Sindh from Bombay Presidency<br> and subsequently of Pakistan movement, including Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto, Sir Abdullah Haroon, Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah, Khan Bahadur Mohammad <br>Ayub Khuhro, Shaikh Abdul Majid Sindhi and others. It was in this background that Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah, an alumnus of SMI <br>and renowned educationist used to call SMI “Child of Sindh and Mother of Pakistan.” Besides the freedom fighters SMI has produced great educationists, jurists, soldiers and men of letters: some of them are: Allama I.I. Kazi, Allama Umer Bin Mohammad Daudpota, A.K. Brohi, Ali Ahmed Brohi, Lt Gen Ghulam<br> Mohammad Malik and several others who constitute its proud Roll-of-Honor.</p>
                <p class="para7">After the demise of Quaid-e-Azam, SMI witnessed a period of decline due to indifferent attitude of the private management board<br> that ran the affairs of the institution at that time. The first casualty was the scheme of Boarding Houses (hostels), disconnecting the link of the<br> institution with rest of the province and beyond. This was followed by constructing long rows of shops on the prime-most land given for the sole<br> purpose of education, in utter disregard of aesthetics as well as respect for the philosophy of education. Slowly and gradually, the institution lost its grandeur<br> and by 1972 it had been reduced to a non-descript local school from an institution of international repute.</p>
